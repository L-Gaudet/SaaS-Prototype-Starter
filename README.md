# SaaS Prototype Starter

Welcome to my SaaS prototype starter. I started to develop my SaaS using Ruby on Rails and decided to make this public as a generic starting point for others who want to build a SaaS. (Will be posting an article on my blog about this)

The starter isn't quite finished yet, but take a look around and feel free to add to it!

More details to come...

Cheers,
